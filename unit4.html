<h2>1.INTRODUCTION TO BLOG</h2>
<p>A blog (a truncation of "weblog") is an informational website consisting of discrete, often informal diary-style text entries (posts). Posts are typically displayed in reverse chronological order so that the most recent post appears first, at the top of the web page.<br>
Blogs are a type of regularly updated websites that provide insight into a certain topic. The word blog is a combined version of the words “web” and “log.” At their inception, blogs were simply an online diary where people could keep a log about their daily lives on the web.<br>
A blog (short for “weblog”) is an online journal or informational website run by an individual, group, or corporation that offers regularly updated content (blog post) about a topic. It presents information in reverse chronological order and it's written in an informal or conversational style.<br>
<br>In 1997, Jorn Barger, blogger for Robot Wisdom, coined the term “weblog”, which was meant to describe his process for “logging the web” as he surfed the internet. The term “weblog” was shortened to “blog” in 1999, by programmer Peter Merholz.</p>

<h2>3.POST MANAGEMENT</h2>
<p><b>Here's some information about post management in HTML:</b><br>
<br><b>a.)POST request method</b><br>
POST is an HTTP request method that requests a web server to accept data enclosed in the body of a request message. It's often used to upload files or submit completed web forms.<br>
<br><b>b.)Method="post" attribute value</b><br>
The value of the "method="post" attribute specifies that the form data will be sent to the server by storing it in an HTTP request body.<br>
<br><b>c.)POST method and GET method</b><br>
The main difference between POST and GET methods is that POST carries request parameters in the message body, while GET carries request parameters appended in the URL string.<br>
<br><b>d.)PostHTML</b><br>
PostHTML is a tool that transforms HTML/XML with JS plugins. It takes raw HTML and parses it into an AST by way of JSON.<br>
<br><b>e.)HTML form methods</b><br>
Forms in HTML can use either method by specifying "method="POST" or "method="GET" (default) in the < form> element.<br>
