<h2> 1.HISTORY OF WWW</h2>
<p>The World Wide Web (WWW) was invented in 1989 by Tim Berners-Lee and his colleagues at CERN, a scientific organization in Geneva, Switzerland. The Web was originally developed to allow scientists to share information automatically. It was opened to the public in 1991. 
</p>
<p>The Web was designed to make information easy to access and allow users to explore relationships between different pages. Berners-Lee coined the term "World Wide Web" and wrote the first Web server, "httpd," and the first client program, "WorldWideWeb," in 1990.</p>
<p>The Web is a service that operates over the Internet, similar to email and Usenet. The term is often used incorrectly as a synonym for the Internet. </p>
<h2>2.EVOLUTION OF HTML</h2>
<p>HTML was created by Sir Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991 but was not officially released. It was published in 1995 as HTML 2.0. HTML 4.01 was published in late 1999 and was a major version of HTML.
</p>
<p>HTML is a very evolving markup language and has evolved with various versions updating. Long before its revised standards and specifications are carried in, each version has allowed its user to create web pages in a much easier and prettier way and make sites very efficient.

HTML 1.0 was released in 1993 with the intention of sharing information that can be readable and accessible via web browsers. But not many of the developers were involved in creating websites. So the language was also not growing.
Then comes HTML 2.0, published in 1995, which contains all the features of HTML 1.0 along with a few additional features, which remained the standard markup language for designing and creating websites until January 1997 and refined various core features of HTML.
Then comes HTML 3.0, where Dave Raggett introduced a fresh paper or draft on HTML. It included improved new features of HTML, giving more powerful characteristics for webmasters in designing web pages. But these powerful features of the new HTML slowed down the browser in applying further improvements.
Then comes HTML 4.01, which is widely used and was a successful version of HTML before HTML 5.0, which is currently released and used worldwide. HTML 5 can be said for an extended version of HTML 4.01, which was published in the year 2012.
</p>
<h2>3.DIFFERENT HTML versions</h2>
<p><b><i>HTML 1.0</b></i></p>
<p>Developed by Sir Tim Berners-Lee in 1991, this was the first version of HTML.</p>
<p><b><i>HTML 2.0</b></i></p>
<p>Released in 1995, this version included tables for tabular data and defined many core HTML features. It was the standard for website design until 1997.</p>
<p><b><i>HTML 3.2</b></i></p>
<p>Released in 1997, this version introduced forms for user input and support for basic stylesheets.</p>
<p><b><i>HTML 4.0</b></i></p>
<p>Released in 1999, this version was the most widely used version in the 2000s.</p>
<p><b><i>HTML 4.01</b></i></p>
<p>Released in 1999, this version was a major version of HTML and became an official standard in 1999.</p>
<p><b><i>HTML 5.0</b></i></p>
<p>Released in 2014, this version removes the <a>this tag and introduces the <abbr> tag. It also removes the <meta> tag, which is defined in the header section of the HTML document.</p> 
<h2>4.WHY html5?</h2>
<p>Introduction: HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It is used to design web pages using a markup language. HTML is an abbreviation of Hypertext and Markup language. Hypertext defines the link between the web pages. The markup language is used to define the text document within the tag which defines the structure of web pages. HTML 5 is the fifth and current version of HTML. It has improved the markup available for documents and has introduced application programming interfaces (API) and Document Object Model (DOM). </p>
<p>Features:</p>

<p> a.)It has introduced new multimedia features which supports both audio and video controls by using < audio > and < video> tags.<br>
b.)There are new graphics elements including vector graphics and tags.<br>
c.)Enrich semantic content by including < header> < footer>, < article>, < section> and < figure> are added.<br>
d.)Drag and Drop- The user can grab an object and drag it further dropping it to a new location.<br>
e.)Geo-location services- It helps to locate the geographical location of a client.<br>
f.)Web storage facility which provides web application methods to store data on the web browser.<br>
g.)Uses SQL database to store data offline.<br>
h.)Allows drawing various shapes like triangle, rectangle, circle, etc.<br>
i.)Capable of handling incorrect syntax.<br>
j.)Easy DOCTYPE declaration i.e., < !doctype html><br>
k.)Easy character encoding i.e., < meta charset=”UTF-8″></p>
<h2>5.HTML4 vs HTML5 </h2> 
<p>HTML5 is the latest and more advanced version of HTML4. HTML5 includes new tags, features, and simplified functions. HTML5 also offers more flexibility to developers for creating websites.

<h2>6.HTML5 New Features</h2>
<p>a.)Semantic Elements:When constructing an HTML script, the term “semantic” refers to the meaning of the text. Semantics, to put it simply, is the use of HTML tags that accurately reflect the content they contain. For instance, using the < div> tag doesn’t suggest the content it will carry, however using the < p> tag suggests it can be used to hold paragraph information. <br>
<br>b.)Audio and Video Support:One of the many HTML 5 features is the support for audio and video. It has reduced the hassle of relying upon third-party services such as Adobe Flash player. To embed Audio and Video into your HTML document, you may use the following two tags, < audio> and < video> tags. <br>
<br>c.)Canvas Elements:Canvas Elements is a top-notch feature that has made the tedious task of handling graphics easier for developers. With the help of Canvas elements, you can easily draw graphics using JavaScript. It is optimum for creating simple animations and drawing photo compositions. 

To initialize the Canvas element < canvas> tag is used with only two specific attributes, width and height. Once, the element is initialized, it is then taken care of with the help of JavaScript to draw shapes, lines, images, and more.<br>
<br>d.)Geolocation API:The Geolocation API is an HTML feature that is used to access the geographical position of a user, however, it is not accessed unless the user approves of it. If you’re wondering where this feature is useful, these come in handy while creating apps like taxi apps, food order tracking apps, fitness tracking apps, and more. <br>
<br>e.)Local Storage:It is a modern feature of HTML and several browsers that typically store data in the user’s browsers and can access them with the help of JavaScript APIs. This feature is useful for creating offline applications where data is need to be stored locally. 

Moreover, using this feature you can reduce the transactions between the application and the backend server, creating a fast application. However, there are some limitations, such as there is limited storage, and you can not access more storage than that. <br>
<br>f.)Responsive Images:Earlier to create responsive images on the web, you have to rely upon several lines of CSS and sometimes JavaScript, however, HTML 5 makes the process handy by including srcset attribute to specify multiple versions of an image at different screen resolutions. <br>
<br>g.)Web Workers:When you are performing several demanding tasks at once, the browser gets sluggish and responds slowly. Because of this, web workers were added to HTML 5 to allow scripts to operate in the background without interfering with the UI thread. 

This may be used to execute demanding operations like multimedia processing in the background. To further demonstrate the usage of Web Workers, we shall create a simple counter app that starts the counter when you click ‘start’ and stop the counting when you click ‘stop’. <br>
<br>h.)Drag and Drop API:Drag and drop is among the most unique features of HTML5 that allow you to grab any element in the DOM and drop it to a different location. To create an element able to drag and drop, set the attribute “draggable” on the tag and put its value to true. <br>
<br>i.)Form Enhancements:HTML 5 introduces new features for your existing forms on HTML to create a more robust user experience. Some of the key enhancements in the new HTML 5 include new input times such as email, URL, and more, placeholder text, required fields feature, validation, and more. <br>
<br>j.)Web Sockets:In the previous versions of HTML, when a client sends a request to the backend server, the server then responds afterward. However, in HTML 5 we can establish a bidirectional live communication between the server and the client (a web browser) to reduce the latency in the responses. 

It has its usage in large-scale applications due to its capability of handling large amounts of connections simultaneously between the server and the client such as online gaming applications, live trading, and other live low-latency applications. <br>
<br>k.)Micro Data:Micro Data in simpler words is a further deeper level to provide semantics to your webpage. This feature is used to structure data in HTML documents by embedding your own customized elements. <br>

There are five global attributes: <br>

1.)itemref,<br> 
2)itemmid,<br> 
3.)itemscope,<br> 
4.)itemprop, and <br>
5.)itemtype <br>
These attributes are used to give the HTML elements more context to define the role they play in the webpage. Microdata may be used to specify a variety of structured data, such as details about events, items, companies, and more. Here is an example of how microdata can be used in HTML.<br>
<br>l.)Cross Document Messaging:In general, web browsers don’t let web pages from different domains influence each other, this is done for several security reasons, however, even if the web pages don’t intend to intrigue the privacy or harm the other web page. There are several scenarios, in which you want to access cross-document communication to make your web page more interactive with less effort. 

Some of these scenarios are when you want to embed data from third-party sites such as maps, photos, videos, and more. This can be achieved in HTML 5 with the feature of cross-document messaging, to enable real-time communication between different parts of websites opened in different frames, windows, etc. <br></p>

<h2>7.Browser Supports</h2>
<p> HTML5 is supported by all the major browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera, as well as iOS for Chrome and Safari and Android browsers. It can even work with the older and less popular browsers like Internet Explorer.</p>
<h2>8.Backward Compatibility</h2>
<p>HTML5 is designed, as much as possible, to be backward compatible with existing all major web browsers. New features build on existing features and allow you to provide fallback content for older browsers. It is suggested to detect support for individual HTML5 features using a few lines of JavaScript.</p>
